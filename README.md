**Known Bugs**
| Problem | Workaround |
|--|--|
| Clicks don't always register |This is both an issue with PyGame and malpractice due to the way PyGame handles click events. Right now the only workaround is to click multiple times until it works.  |
|Fishing doesn't always work|Walk towards the water again. Fishing will only register within 3 seconds of touching water.|
|Choice text extends past screen|To be fixed
